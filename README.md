2025 ENVS 193 DS Homework 3 Assignment 

- For this assignment, we are working with the personal data we have been tracking over the past quarter, creating a visualization, and revisiting and analyzing figures for the statistical critique.

General Information

- For this assignment, I am analyzing a personal dataset that I collected throughout the Spring 2025 quarter, spanning from approximately April 17th to May 27th. As running is one of my favorite forms of exercise, I wanted to explore whether my average caloric intake and sleep duration had any impact on the distance I ran each day. For the statistical critique, I am using the following published paper:
Mintzer, V. J., & Fazioli, K. L. (2021). Salinity and water temperature as predictors of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) encounter rates in Upper Galveston Bay, Texas. Frontiers in Marine Science, 8. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.754686 


Data and File Information 

- My dataset focuses on the relationship between miles run, hours of sleep, and daily caloric intake to identify any patterns or correlations that might affect my running performance.
For my data visualization, I created a calendar-style graphic inspired by the Dear Data project. In this visualization, different shapes and colors represent various aspects of my data, allowing me to visually track consistency and trends in my daily habits over time.

Paper Critique Summary

- The study I am analyzing for this assignment is titled "Salinity and Water Temperature as Predictors of Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) Encounter Rates in Upper Galveston Bay, Texas." This study examines the impact of water temperature and salinity on bottlenose dolphin encounter rates in Galveston Bay, Texas. In this study, the authors aim to determine if environmental factors influence their habitat and understand how temperature changes affect dolphin encounter rates.
